# 4D Technical Assessment - React/Node.js

## Introduction

Welcome to the technical assessment for the 4D Engineering team. This assessment simulates a real-world project scenario where you'll work on Admin Insurance, our document management system designed for large organizations.

## Project Overview

Admin Insurance helps organizations manage employee documentation processes across multiple countries. The system handles form submissions, document processing, and maintains data security and accessibility standards.

## Current System Components

1. Landing Page: Basic introduction and navigation
2. Form Page: Form submission 
3. Results Page: Data search

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd admin-insurance
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev:full

# Or start them separately:
npm run dev        # Frontend only
npm run server     # Backend only
```

4. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## Project Structure
```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/          # API services
â”œâ”€â”€ server/                # Backend server code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e/              # End-to-end tests
â””â”€â”€ tickets/              # Implementation tickets
```

## Testing

The project includes both WebDriverIO and Playwright for testing. Here's an example test:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/playwright/form.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('form submission workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to form page
  await page.goto('/form');
  
  // Fill required fields
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.fill('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'john.doe@example.com');
  
  // Submit form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  // Verify submission
  await expect(page.locator('text=Form submitted successfully')).toBeVisible();
});
```

Run tests using:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:wdio
npm run test:playwright
```

## Implementation Tickets

Detailed specifications for each implementation task can be found in the `tickets/` directory. Please select the tickets assigned to you and implement them according to the specifications.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Code architecture and design patterns
- Component structure and reusability
- Testing implementation
- Documentation quality
- Performance optimization techniques

## Note About AI Tools

While you may use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot for assistance, ensure that you fully understand and can explain all code implementations. The core solution should reflect your technical thinking and problem-solving approach.

## Documentation  

Your **detailed documentation** should go here, outlining how you approached each challenge. The more detailed, the betterâ€”it helps us understand your thought process and decision-making.
